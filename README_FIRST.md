# Important notes about files in this project

The `index.html` main homepage file in the root directory is generated via the bash script every time the bash script is run.
So, don't change this `index.html` file in root directory directly. Instead, change the `homepage_bs_footer.txt` or `homepage_bs_header.txt` files if you want to edit the rootdir `index.html` homepage.
